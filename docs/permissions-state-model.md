# Shared permissions state model (Web + iOS)

The canonical capability copy now lives in `docs/permissions-capability-matrix.md` and its schema in `docs/permissions-capability-matrix.schema.json`.

Shared state vocabulary remains:

- **Allowed**
- **Blocked**
- **Limited**
- **Action needed**

Shared capability names:

- Notifications
- Background refresh
- Biometric / passkey
- Calendar

## Non-coder note

A single vocabulary and matrix keeps explanations consistent for users and support staff across web and iOS.
